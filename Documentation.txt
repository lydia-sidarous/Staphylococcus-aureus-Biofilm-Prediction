Project Title: 
Prediction of biofilm-forming Staphylococcus aureus isolates based on the presence/absence of kmers from biofilm-related genes in the isolate genomes.

Biofilm-related genes (12): bap, clfA, clfB, cna, ebps, eno, fnbA, fnbB, icaA, icaB,icaC, icaD

Input to the models: Kmer presence absence matrix having S. aureus sample IDs as row, 31-mers as columns and binary labels (0&1).
Label for non-biofilm forming isolate --> 0, label for biofilm-forming isolates --> 1.

Models to be built:
1- RandomForest using the full kmer presence/absence matrix of dimensions (120, 22345)
2- Support Vector Machine using the full kmer presence/absence matrix of dimensions (120, 22345)
3- Support Vector Machine using a filtered kmer presence/absence matrix of dimensions (120, 1365) of the kmers used to build 
the RandomForest model only.

Project algorithms and phases are detailed in the README file to aid in navigation of the project scripts.
